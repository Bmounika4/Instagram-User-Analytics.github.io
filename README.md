Performing user analysis on MySQL workbench and analyze the Instagram user data and answering questions about the future decisions of the online application.

After performing Marketing analysis and investor metrics,
My insights are as follows,

•	From the ad campaign query, we concluded that the most users register accounts on “Thursday” and also “Sunday”. The marketing team should schedule their ad campaign on “Thursday” as their will be a possibility that more number of users will see the ad rather than in other days.  As more people will see the ad, it will be reach more people by the word of the mouth.

•	List of Inactive users should be persuaded to return to the platform by sending new promotional E-Mails.

•	Partner brand can use these 5 most popular hashtags in their posts to increase their engagement: smile, beach, party, fun and concert.

•	Rewards should be given to both loyal users as well as the contest winner as it will increase the user engagement on the platform too.

•	Preventive measures should be taken to take down all the bots and fake accounts in order to optimization the security measures of the users.
